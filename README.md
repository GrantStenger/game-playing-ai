# Building game-playing AI.

To Do's: 
* Implement MiniMax 
* Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Build Javascript front-end
* Optimize runtime (encode boards as bits, potentially rewrite in C++, be more careful with recursion)

To get to chess, implement minimax with possibly some simple heuristics on connect-4. 
To understand minimax well, solve tic-tac-toe.
Side project, try some sort of minimax + heuristic algo on 2048.
